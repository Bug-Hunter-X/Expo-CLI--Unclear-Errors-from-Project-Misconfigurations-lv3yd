This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has unexpected or invalid configurations in its `package.json`, `app.json`, or other configuration files.  It's often triggered by typos, missing dependencies, incorrect versions, or conflicting plugin configurations.  The error message itself can be vague, making debugging challenging.  For example, you might encounter a generic error like `Error: Command failed` without specific details about the cause.
