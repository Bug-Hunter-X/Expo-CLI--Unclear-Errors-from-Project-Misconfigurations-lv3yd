This repository demonstrates an example of an Expo project generating a cryptic error due to misconfiguration. The `problematicProject.json` file shows the erroneous configuration, which results in a generic error from the Expo CLI. The `fixedProject.json` file provides the corrected configuration. The error is not specific to a particular Expo version but is a common occurrence across multiple versions due to the vague nature of error handling in some cases. The goal is to illustrate a typical but hard-to-debug Expo CLI issue and provide a solution.
